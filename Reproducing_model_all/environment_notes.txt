# note on environment and required directories.

Follow the below steps to preprocess the data, train the DeepCDR model and infer based on the trained model.

The previous code by the original authors has been adjusted to accoodate newer version of packages.
package install

1. Install packages using the tf_env_2.yml file. - (Running into issues however).
To do this you can do "conda env create -f tf_env_2.yml -n env_name"

2. If you fail to create the environment with the yml file, use the below lines in the terminal.

conda create -n DeepCDR_env
conda install tensorflow==2.13.1
pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2
pip install pandas
pip install rdkit 
pip install deepchem 
pip install matplotlib

The version for pandas is 2.1.2, deepchem is 2.5.0, and rdkit is 2023.9.1, and matplotlib is 3.8.1




Also create a directory namd "Models" for saving the models. 
You will also need to store the csa_data in the working directory
and have the improve_utils.py file working directory.
